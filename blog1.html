            <h4>WHAT TO PACK FOR A SUMMER VACATION</h4> <br>
            <p>I’m a Caribbean island gal at heart. I’ve gone to Bermuda a few times. Once I even hosted a trip there!
                I’ve also been to Barbados quite a bit for Crop Over to enjoy a weeks worth of amazing parties and
                activities and of course to Play Mas! St. Kitts was the 3rd Caribbean Island I’ve ever visited and it
                didn’t disappoint. If anything, it fueled my desire to visit even more islands to experience the
                different histories, unique foods and cultures. I was invited by the Tourism Board of St. Kitts to
                experience St. Kitts Restaurant Week and I had an incredible time eating my way through this amazing
                island. So if you plan on visiting St. Kitts (and you definitely should), I’ve compiled a list of things
                you must do, see and of course stupendous places to eat! Make sure to save and share this post for your
                next island adventure! <br> <br> <br>


                HOW TO GET THERE + TRANSPORTATION <br> <br>

                American Airlines just began their direct flights to and from St. Kitts from Miami International
                Airport. It’s a super quick 3 hour flight so it works out great for a weekend trip from Miami! <br>

                Kayan Jet Transfers: Book the Kayan Jet Experience. A luxury car is waiting for you after deplaning and
                will whisk you away to a premier lounge where you will enjoy a quick meal and champagne while the
                attendants get your bags and handle your customs. I thoroughly enjoyed not having to wait for my bags or
                going through customs the traditional way. The meal they served was delicious salmon and after that 3
                hour flight, kicking back in a push chair while eating was just what I needed. I highly recommend this
                service to cut down on confusion with customs as well. <br> <br> <br>

                WHERE TO STAY <br> <br>

                St. Kitts Marriott: I had the luxury of staying at the St. Kitts Marriott which boasts it’s own casino,
                several pools with swim up bars and it’s own private beach! I enjoyed the spacious rooms and the
                bathrooms even had bidets! I also looked forward to the delicious breakfast buffets every morning with
                everything your heart could desire..including festival! <br>

                Park Hyatt St. Kitts Christophe Harbour: Although I didn’t personally stay here, we did get to visit the
                grounds and tour this hotel and it is absolutely breathtaking. It’s a little further away from the main
                town so would be great for couples or for a special getaway where you’re looking to unplug. It’s more
                modern than it’s counterparts and gives a visually aesthetic vibe if that’s what you’re into. <br> <br> <br>



                WHERE TO EAT <br> <br>

                If you can make it to St. Kitts definitely go during their Music Week, Restaurant Week or Carnival
                because you will have so my options of exciting things to do, see and experience. During St. Kitts
                Restaurant Week all of the restaurants we visited had special menus with unbeatable prices, so you get
                the most of the cuisine for your money! From vegetarian menus to rum tastings there is something for
                every palate in St. Kitts. Below, are just a few of the places I had the opportunity to dine at that I
                highly recommend. <br> <br>

                Marshalls <br>

                Marshalls is in entire vibe and great for a romantic dinner. It’s perched in a residential area on a
                cliff where you can look out onto the sea and Nevis, St. Kitts sister island in the distance. This
                restaurant also has a pool. I had one of the best meals in St. Kitts at Marshalls. I went with steak and
                it was one of the most delicious steaks I’ve ever had. We also got to meet the chef who was a gem. <br> <br>

                Spice Mill <br>

                Spice Mill is perfect for lunch because it’s right on a private beach. You can eat and then go take a
                dip in the ocean. The water is pristine and beautiful with mountains in the distance as you sit and eat.
                The Jerk Nachos and the homemade lemonade are a must. I also enjoyed my mahi mahi fish dish with rice
                and peas. Oh they have Jerk Pizza too! Bring your bathing suit for a dip after you digest your
                delectable meal. <br> <br>

                Carambola Beach Club <br> 

                Carambola Beach Club is a sophisticated fun party vibe. It has it’s own private beach and they have a DJ
                spinning all the latest tunes. When we went there was a buffet style menu with about 5-6 different
                stations of varying cuisines, from vegan to sushi, to desserts and of course meats and fishes. I enjoyed
                the vibes of this restaurant the most. People dress up and go and have an amazing time. The crowd is fun
                too. I LOVED the food. Everything was stellar and I’m most definitely going back the next time I’m in
                St. Kitts. <br> <br>

                Ital Creations <br>

                Ital Creations was a treat because it’s vegetarian and all of the ingredients are from the garden of the
                restaurant. We got to have a tour of the gardens which included tons of vegetables, herbs and fruits. I
                got a quick lesson is what foods help with digestion and illness as well as got to eat fresh mangos from
                the tree. This is a local place and it’s a must especially if you’re plant based. <br> <br> <br>
                 WHAT TO DO & SEE <br> <br>

                When it comes to things to do and see there’s so much that St. Kitts has to offer. I wish I had the time
                to get over to Nevis the sister island which is a quick ferry ride over, but I’ll have to plan that for
                my return visit. If you’re the adventurous type, the beach type or a mixture of both, there’s something
                for everyone in St. Kitts. <br> <br>

                Timothy Hill Overlook <br>

                Take a car up to Timothy Hill Overlook for a breathtaking view of St. Kitts as well as Nevis in the
                distance and the point at which the Atlantic and Caribbean Sea meet the island. The view will leave you
                awestruck and speechless. We spent about 15 minutes here and I was able to get some stunning photos and
                videos to commemorate the moment! <br> <br>

                Old Road Rum Tour + Rum Tasting <br>

                This was one of my favorite events planned for us by St. Kitts Tourism. We got to learn about the
                history of rum making in St. Kitts. We started the tour with a delicious cocktail as we walked the
                property revealing all of the history of Old Road Rum. Then we had the opportunity to do a rum tasting
                which I thoroughly enjoyed. If you want to learn more of the history of St. Kitts, this is a must do.
                Also if you love rum, this is a must do! <br> <br>

                Rainforest Tour with Tour Guide O’Neill <br>

                This was the highlight of my trip to St. Kitts. I’m a nature girl and this was a venture I’ll never
                forget. From swinging on vines, climbing tree stumps, eating fresh mangos, learning about different
                leaves and wildlife, this experience was wonderful. O’Neill was stellar in his approach to the tour as
                well. I learned a lot and was intrigued with all of the knowledge he dropped on us throughout the tour.
                Dress appropriately because you’re in the rainforest and it can get sticky, hot and messy real quick!
                Bring sneakers, a waist pack and a bottle of water for your journey and thank me later! <br> <br>

                Rum Making at Spice Mill with Hibiscus Spirits <br>

                In the same building at Spice Mill Restaurant there is Hibiscus Spirits where you can take a quick and
                fun rum making class! I was able to measure out and make my very own rum to my own specifications and
                likes! This was such a great group activity so if you’re on a group trip, this is a must! You’ll leave
                with your own bottle of home made rum! <br> <br><br>


                WHAT TO PACK <br>

                St. Kitts is hot and humid so pack accordingly. Easy breezy linen dresses are perfect for day events.
                Make sure to pack plenty of hats, especially for tours! The sun is hot and you’ll want the extra
                protection. Of course pack your swimsuits because the water in St. Kitts especially on the Caribbean
                side is gorgeous and you’ll want to hop right in. A good sized tote goes a long way too, especially if
                you’re not staying in St. Kitts proper. There will be 15-20 travel times from one side of the island to
                the other and you’ll want a bag that stores everything you may need.  <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br> <br>
